          <!-- about you -->
          <p>
            Welcome to my CV. I'm a senior undergraduate student at Emory
            University. I major in Computer Science and PPL
            (Philosophy,Politics,&Law), and plan to pursue my career as an
            academic researcher. My main academic interest lies in the
            intersection of human centered computing, computer security, and
            social and political implications related to user experience.
